Project Overview

This capstone project investigates wildfire risk across Europe using five years of satellite-detected fire data combined with environmental and conservation datasets. The primary aim is to identify spatial and temporal fire patterns, build a predictive model to estimate near-term fire risk, and highlight protected areas most exposed to future wildfire activity.

NASA FIRMS VIIRS fire detections form the core dataset, covering a continuous multi-year period across Europe. These data are cleaned, aggregated, and explored through single-variable and multi-variable analysis to understand seasonality, regional clustering, and historical fire behaviour. A machine-learning pipeline is then developed to classify and predict high-risk fire zones for the following year.

To extend the environmental relevance of the analysis, predicted fire-risk zones are spatially overlaid with protected-area boundaries. An additional biodiversity exposure layer is created using global biodiversity occurrence data filtered to species listed in threatened categories on the IUCN Red List. This allows identification of conservation regions where predicted wildfire risk and threatened-species presence intersect.

The final output is a reproducible geospatial modelling pipeline that combines fire-risk prediction with conservation and biodiversity exposure mapping. The project demonstrates end-to-end data collection, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, predictive modelling, and spatial risk communication within a real-world environmental context.
